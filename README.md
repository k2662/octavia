## About
__OCTAVIA__, **O**ctobanana's **C**ustomizable **T**ext-based **A**udio **V**isualization **I**nteractive **A**pplication.

__octavia__ is an audio visualizer for the terminal.

### Features
* Capture and visualize audio in real-time
* Keybindings allow interactive configuration during runtime
* Displays the frequency spectrum as bars and peaks
* Each bar represents a logarithmically spaced frequency range
* The height of each bar represents the magnitude of the frequency range in decibels
* The bars and peaks move at different speeds
* Uses unicode block elements for smooth transitions
* Mono or stereo audio capture
* Vertical or horizontal layout
* Shared or stacked stereo layout
* Fixed height bar mode
* True colour support
* Low-high or high-low frequency ordering
* Left/right stereo channel layout can be swapped
* Configurable bar width and spacing
* Configurable min/max decibel thresholds
* Configurable min/max frequency thresholds
* Savitzkyâ€“Golay filter for smoothing
* IIR low pass filter
* IIR high pass filter
* IIR high shelf filter

### Future Features
* UI overlay
* Custom colours
* Custom keybindings
* Command prompt
* Config file support
* Config file live reload
* Output raw characters to stdout or a file

## Usage
View the usage and help output with the `-h|--help` flag,
or as a plain text file in `./doc/help.txt`.

### Getting Started
Run `octavia` and play some audio!

Press `?` to view the keybindings section of the help output, press `q` to return to the program.  
Press `q` to quit.  
Press `o` to toggle the debug overlay.  
Press `a` to toggle vertical/horizontal layout.  
Press `s` to toggle mono/stereo audio capture.  
Press `d` to toggle shared/stacked layout.  
Press `f` to toggle flipped layout.  
Press `z` or `x` to toggle bars/peaks on/off.  
Press `g` to cycle through available smoothing filters.  
Press `h` or `H` to change the minimum frequency threshold.  
Press `j` or `J` to change the minimum decibel threshold.  
Press `j` or `J` to change the maximum decibel threshold.  
Press `l` or `L` to change the maximum frequency threshold.  

## Pre-Build
This section describes what environments this program may run on,
any prior requirements or dependencies needed, and any third party libraries used.

> #### Important
> Any shell commands using relative paths are expected to be executed in the
> root directory of this repository.

### Environments
* __Linux__ (supported)
* __BSD__ (supported)
* __macOS__ (supported)

### Compilers
* __GCC__ >= 8.0.0 (supported)
* __Clang__ >= 7.0.0 (supported)
* __Apple Clang__ >= 11.0.0 (untested)

### Dependencies
* __CMake__ >= 3.8
* __Boost__ >= 1.72.0
* __ICU__ >= 62.1
* __SFML__ >= 2.5.1
* __PThread__

### Linked Libraries
* __pthread__ (libpthread) POSIX threads library
* __icuuc__ (libicuuc) part of the ICU library
* __icui18n__ (libicui18n) part of the ICU library
* __sfml-audio__ (libsfml-audio) part of the SFML library
* __sfml-system__ (libsfml-system) part of the SFML library
* __boost_coroutine__ (libboost_coroutine) Boost coroutine library

### Included Libraries
* [__Belle__](https://github.com/octobanana/belle):
  Asynchronous input and signal handling, modified and included as `./src/ob/belle`
* [__Parg__](https://github.com/octobanana/parg):
  CLI arg parser, modified and included as `./src/ob/parg.hh`
* [__kissfft__](https://github.com/mborgerding/kissfft):
  A mixed-radix Fast Fourier Transform, modified and included as `./src/ob/fft.hh`

### macOS
Using a new version of __GCC__ or __Clang__ is __required__, as the default
__Apple Clang compiler__ does __not__ support C++17 Standard Library features such as `std::filesystem`.

A new compiler can be installed through a third-party package manager such as __Brew__.
Assuming you have __Brew__ already installed, the following commands should install
the latest __GCC__.

```sh
brew install gcc
brew link gcc
```

The following CMake argument will then need to be appended to the end of the line when running the shell script.
Remember to replace the placeholder `<path-to-g++>` with the canonical path to the new __g++__ compiler binary.

```sh
./RUNME.sh build -- -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER='<path-to-g++>'
```

## Build
The included shell script will build the project in release mode using the `build` subcommand:

```sh
./RUNME.sh build
```

## Install
The included shell script will install the project in release mode using the `install` subcommand:

```sh
./RUNME.sh install
```

## Troubleshooting
If __octavia__ is not responding to audio being played, make sure your systems default audio capture stream is set to monitor of built-in audio analog stereo, or something similar. On Linux, this can be done with the program __pavucontrol__. While __octavia__ is running, launch __pavucontrol__. Within __pavucontrol__, select the recording tab, then choose monitor of built-in audio analog stereo in the drop down for the capture stream of __octavia__.
